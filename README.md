This project is still in its very early stages. It is currently geared towards an Okinawan style,

10 minimum, 1 max (10th kyu as min).

    *   Keeping track of the students and if they've paid for the month
    *   The students "isPaidUp" flag with reset every month, allowing the user to be aware

            that they missed a payment
